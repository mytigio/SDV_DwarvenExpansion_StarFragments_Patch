[center][size=6]Dwarven Expansion / Star Fragments - Forage Furniture Weapons and Crafting[/size][/center]
A patch to add support for Dwarven Expansion features to new minerals added in Star Fragments - Forage Furniture Weapons and Crafting.

[size=5]New Machine Recipes[/size]

[size=4]Jewelry Maker[/size]
Adds 10 new Jewelry Maker recipes, each gem in Star Fragments will create a Jeweled Diadem which is an artisan good that can be sold for profit.  They are colored based on the input gem used, and their quality and price are also based on the input gem.
Each uses the named mineral from Star Fragments in it's creation.

[size=4]Gemstone Polisher[/size]
Any item from Star Fragments that uses the gem category can be improved in the gem polisher.
(this feature does not require this patch)

[size=4]Dwarven Pulverizer[/size]
All gems added by Star Fragments will automatically pulverize in a general Gemstone Dust (named for the input) and matching in price.
These generic dusts can be used to make Infused Spirits just like any other.
